== How to run integration tests

In addition to the unit tests driven by gradle this directory
contains tests using https://github.com/andamira/aserta[aserta].

A bash driven testing suite runner which allows to do easy testing
running in a shell.

To run the tests first make sure you've built jbang first, added `jbang` to the path, cd to this directory and run the link:test_suite.sh[test_suite.sh].

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew build install
export PATH=`pwd`/build/install/jbang/bin:$PATH
cd itests
./test_suite.sh
