Ever tried out Java 10+ support for running .java files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome ?

Then try `jbang` which gives you:

* `.java` Scripting for Java 8 and upwards
* `.jsh` via JShell from Java 9 and upwards
* Dependency declarations using `//DEPS <gav>` for automatic dependency resolution
* Compiled jar and Dependency resolution caching
* Launch with debug enabled for instant debugging from your favorite IDE
* Generate gradle file with dependencies for easy editing in your favorite IDE (`jbang --edit myfile.java`)
* Installable with HomeBrew or SDKman on OSX and Linux.
* (PLANNED) Installable with Chocolatey on Windows
* (PLANNED) Lookup dependencies with a short-hand name, i.e. `// DEPS log4j:1.2+,picocli` for quick getting started.

To use it simply install `jbang` and run `jbang yourscript.java`

toc::[]

== Requirements

Java 8+

Tested and verified to use on OSX, Linux and Windows.

== Installation

To use `jbang` you as a minimum need to have Java 11+ available.

To install both java and `jbang` we recommend https://sdkman.io[sdkman]

[source, bash]
```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash # <.>
source ~/.bash_profile # <.>

sdk install java # <.>
```

Once Java is installed and ready, you install `jbang` with

[source]
----
sdk install jbang
----

To test your installation run:

[source]
----urce]
----
jbang --help
-----

This should print out usage information.

To update run:

[source]
----
sdk update jbang
----

=== Homebrew

On OSX you can install `jbang` with https://brew.sh[Homebrew] using https://github.com/maxandersen/homebrew-tap/[maxandersen/tap].

  brew install maxandersen/tap/jbang

To upgrade to latest version:

  brew upgrade maxandersen/tap/jbang

=== Manual and Windows (for now) install

Unzip the https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang/releases/latest[latest binary release], put the `jbang-<version>/bin` folder in to your `$PATH` and you are set.

== Script input

A script is just a single `.java` file with a classic static main method or a `.jsh` file which will be passed to `jshell`.

Below is an (almost) minimal example you can save in `helloworld.java`:

[source, java]
```
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $? <.>

class helloworld { // <.>

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(args.length==0) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);
        }
    }
}
```
<.> By using this `//` style instead of shebang `#!` you trick `bash`, `zsh` etc. to run this as a script while still being valid java code.
<.> A classname, can be anything when using `jbang` but to be valid java for most IDE's you'll want to name it the same as the source file.

Now to run this you can call it via `jbang`:

[source]
----
jbang helloworld.java
----

or mark it executable and just run it directly:

[source]
----
chmod +x helloworld.java
./helloworld jbang!
----

You can use `http(s):/` and `file:/` url's for input too:

[source]
----
jbang https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxandersen/jbang/master/examples/helloworld.java
----


=== Using `.jsh` for `jshell`

There are experimental support to run `.jsh` via `jshell`. The advantage of `jshell` is that you do not need to have a class or static main method.

Classic `jshell` does not support passing in arguments, `jbang` does.

In the case of `.jsh` files `jbang` injects a startup script that declares a `String[] args` which will contain any passed in arguments.

Example:

[source, java]
----
System.out.println("Hello " + (args.length>0?args[0]:"World")); // <.>
/exit // <.>
----
<1> Line where `args` are accessible without previous declaration.
<2> `/exit` is so the jshell app will exit. If you remove it `jbang` will launch into inter-active mode.

== Getting started

To get started you can run `jbang --init helloworld.java` and a simple java class with a static main is generated.

== Declare dependencies

If you want to write real scripts you will want to use some java libraries.
To specify dependencies you use gradle-style locators. Below are examples for `log4j`.

=== Using `//DEPS`

[source, java]
```
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

//DEPS log4j:log4j:1.2.17 <.>

import static java.lang.System.out;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;

import java.util.Arrays;

class classpath_example {

	static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(classpath_example.class);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicConfigurator.configure(); // <.>
		logger.info("Welcome to jbang");

		Arrays.asList(args).forEach(arg -> logger.warn("arg: " + arg));
		logger.info("Hello from Java!");
	}
}
```
<.> //DEPS has to be start of line and can be one or more space separated dependencies.
<.> Minimal logging setup - required by log4j.

Now when you run this the first time with no existing dependencies installed you should get an output like this:

[source]
----
$ ./classpath_example.java
[jbang] Resolving dependencies...
[jbang]     Resolving log4j:log4j:1.2.17...Done
[jbang] Dependencies resolved
0 [main] INFO classpath_example  - Welcome to jbang
1 [main] INFO classpath_example  - Hello from Java!
----

=== Using `@Grab`

There is also support for using Groovy lang style `@Grab` syntax.

[source, java]
```
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

import static java.lang.System.out;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;

import java.util.Arrays;

import groovy.lang.Grab; // <.>
import groovy.lang.Grapes;

@Grapes({ // <.>
		@Grab(group="org.codehaus.groovy", module="groovy", version="2.5.8"), // <.>
		@Grab(module = "log4j", group = "log4j", version = "1.2.17")
})
class classpath_example {

	static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(classpath_example.class);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicConfigurator.configure();
		Arrays.asList(args).forEach(arg -> out.println(arg));
	}
}
```
<.> Import needed to make the compiler be okey with `@Grab` annotation.
<.> In Groovy you normally put `@Grab` on import statements. That is not allowed in Java thus when having multiple imports you need to put them in a `@Grapes` annotation first.
<.> `jbang` will grab any `@Grab` annotation and assume it is declaring dependencies.

== Debugging

When running `.java` scripts with `jbang` you can pass the `--debug`-flag and the script will enable debug,
suspend the execution and wait until you connect a debugger to port 4004.

[source]
----
jbang --debug helloworld.java
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

You can change the debug port by passing in a number to the debug argument, i.e. `--debug=4321`.

NOTE: Be sure to put a breakpoint in your IDE/debugger before you connect to make the debugger actually stop when you need it.

== Bash/Zsh auto-completion

If you are using bash or zsh in your terminal you can get auto-completion by running the following:

[source]
----
source <(jbang --completion)
----

== Caching

In previous versions of `jbang` Java 10+ direct launch of `.java` was used, but since v0.6 `jbang` works with Java 8 and thus it
needs to do a separate compile step. Besides now working with Java 8 it also allow us to cache the compile step and thus
launch faster on consecutive runs.

The caching goes to `~/.jbang` by default, you can run `jbang --clear-cache` to remove all cache data from this folder.

== FAQ

[qanda]
Why the name j'bang?::
  I was reading up on how to use the new shebang (#!) feature support in Java 10 and came up with the idea of port `kscript` to Java and needed a name.
From there came j'bang which is a "bad" spelling of how shebang is pronounced in french.

Why use of gradle resource locators rather than ?::
  kscript used it and its nice as it is a one-liner and easily parsable.

Why would I use Java to write scripts ? Java sucks for that... Use gradle, kotlin, scala, etc. instead!::
  Well, does it really suck ? With Java 8 streams, static imports and greatly improved standard java libraries it is very close to how kscript and grape looks like.
With the following advantages:
+
* works with plain Java without installing additional compiler/build tools
* all IDE's support editing .java files very well, content assist etc.
* great debugging
+
And to be honest I built `jbang` just to see if I could and get my Java skills refreshed for the newer features in the language.
Use it at your own risk :)

Why not use normal shebang(`\#!`) in the header ?::
  You can use normal shebang (`\#!/usr/bin/env jbang`) and Java 10+ will actually work with it from the command line. Not recommended though as
many tools and especially IDE's will start complaining about syntax errors as they don't ignore the first line in this case.
+
By using the `//` form it is treated as both a bash/shell file AND a valid java file and thus works everywhere a java file will work.
+
Its worth noting that Go https://golangcookbook.com/chapters/running/shebang/[uses a similar approach] which is also where I learned it from.

== Thanks

`jbang` was heavily inspired by how `https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript[kscript]` by Holger Brand works.
